## StarLand's Blog
Simple blog i use to talk about starland's development process

### Post 2
Today i've setup cloudflare on the main website, as well as google analytics. I installed a cookie consent applet and google analytics so i can see what's going on behind the scenes. I don't want to setup Google Ads right now, but that might be something i add in the future.
Update: Google Analytics are now setup on all subdomains

### The First Post
I do wish that i'd have started this earlier, because so much development has gone on before now.
I recently published [the new website](https://playstar.land) and it looks much nicer than before where it was just basic HTML.
I was originally considering doing bootstrap but just ended up using w3.css. I'm currently working on a PVP arena type thing, where kills equal StarCoins, i'm not trying to make it so the only way you can earn starcoins is waiting 15 minutes or microtransactions, i'm no EA.
My builder, Riley is currently working on a lobby for this arena as well as most of the buildings in the game being redone. 
There are still lots of minor and major bugs within starland's code, and some of which are game-breaking. 
The biggest issue is there's a 25% chance that the camera will not initialize properly and it will attach to the character rather than the CFrame of the camerapart.
I've been writing a list down of all the bugs currently known and i will start cracking down on them shortly. 
Development has been inconsistent recently as i've had to be working on school.
Edit: I accidentally deleted the A record for the main website and it should be fixed in like 5 minutes
